	Model	Accuracy	Precision (weighted)	Recall (weighted)	F1-score (weighted)
0	Logistic Regression	0.565217	0.517681	0.565217	0.533717
1	Decision Tree	0.559783	0.523182	0.538043	0.551463
2	Random Forest	0.516304	0.539029	0.554348	0.500888
3	XGBoost	0.565217	0.533703	0.565217	0.54508



we can find that the logistic regression model worked the best of all the models
